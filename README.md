# fitness_project

The 2nd version of fitness blog. 

Even though the first version of the project was built in such a way that it could be improved, I decided to create a new project from scratch.

The second version is in constant development, during which I improve my django skills.

Registration and authorization will be added soon. Ability to leave comments under posts.

The next step is to deploy the site.
